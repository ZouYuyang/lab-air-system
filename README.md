# Laboratory-air-quality-monitor-and-refreshing-system

An Arduino Project which can monitoring the laboratory air quality and control the fans to refreshing the air. The device prevents the experimenter from inhaling toxic gases and causing accidents.The device monitors the gas in the air through a series of MQ series and SHARP dust sensors and not only show the air quality via LEDs, but also starts the fan when necessary.Even so you could also control the fan manually.

All sensors and parts of this project were bought on Taobao. I'll list all the part you may will need in a document.
